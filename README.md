# Snowman_game


In this game, computer will randomly select a word, and we will have to guess alphabets and when it will fit right in the selected word, the dashes will get filled. We will have a snowman, on every wrong alphabet we select, it will lose one of it's part and reduce to none. If the snowman reduces to none, then we lose the game.
